Data Mining

Implements classification based on logistic regression, clustering using K-means and outlier detection using LOF.
All algorithms are implemented from scratch and compared with their correspoding implementations in sklearn

Assignment: Different tasks involved in the assignment
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Dataset Selection

You can select one of the datasets from the below:
a. https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset
b. https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification
c. https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
Once you decide the dataset, you would need to study and understand the dataset in
detail and identify the key questions or insights that you would like to draw from the
dataset.

-----------------------------------------------------
S.No (b) Mushroom Dataset is used for this assignment
-----------------------------------------------------


2. Data Preprocessing and Visualization

You would need to perform exploratory data analysis along with suitable visualizations
and identify/employ different preprocessing techniques suitable for the dataset. You
should implement appropriate data preprocessing techniques studied in the class in
addition to any data cleaning (if required) and show the results.

3. Data Analysis

Based on the insights that you wish to draw from the dataset, you would need to identify
the key DM tasks like association analysis, clustering, classification of outlier analysis
that are applicable for the dataset. You should implement atleast 3 data analysis
techniques and corresponding algorithms studied in the class and show the results.
